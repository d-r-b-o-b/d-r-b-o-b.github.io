%% NSCS 344
%% Assignment 1: Introduction to Matlab
% **** Due date: Start of class in Week 2 ****
% 
% _**** IMPORTANT **** : Installing Matlab can take a while and be somewhat 
% tricky. *Start EARLY* and speak to the TA (Sarah Cook,_ sarahcook@email.arizona.edu_) 
% if you have any problems._ 
%% Part 1: Download and install Matlab (0 points, but essential for the class!)
% Instructions and links are here. Note that _you do NOT have to pay for Matlab 
% if you are enrolled at the University of Arizona!_ If you are asked for credit 
% card information don't give it!  Instead reach out to one of us for help.
% 
% <https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/mathworks-matlab https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/mathworks-matlab>
%% Part 2: Setup Dropbox on your computer (0 points, but also essential for the class!)
% If you don't have it already, download and install from
% 
% <www.dropbox.com www.dropbox.com> 
%% 
% # Make a folder called NSCS344_YOURNAME
% # Share it with Sarah (sarahcook@email.arizona.edu) 
% # Share it with me (<mailto:bobcwilson@gmail.com bobcwilson@gmail.com>, note 
% my dropbox account uses my Gmail account not Arizona account).
%% Part 3: Implement the model (8 points)
% _Note: The code for this is all there in this week's notes (on D2L). In addition, 
% the videos on D2L walk you through all the first two parts of the Assignment 
% in detail._ 
%% 
% # Make a folder inside your Dropbox folder called "Assignment_01"
% # Make a script in Matlab (call it, for example, Script_01) that makes one 
% decision in the dots task and save it into the Assignment_01 folder
%% Part 4: Go beyond! (2 points)
%% 
% # Go beyond what's covered in the course material for this week and change 
% the parameters of the model.  Copy and paste your code into a second script 
% (save it in your Dropbox folder as Script_02) and change the values of D and 
% f and T. 
% # Add comments in your code to describe what happens when you change these 
% variables.  How do you think accuracy changes on average as D increases?  As 
% f increases?  As T increases?
%% Part 5: Go _way_ beyond! (2 extra credit points)
% _This is a totally optional extra credit item intended to stretch people with 
% prior coding knowledge. But there's nothing here that requires knowledge beyond 
% what we've covered this week so coding novices can do it just as well._
%% 
% # Make a new script (call it Script_03) and change the model in some way. 
% For example, how would you model a "forgetting" process in which people forget 
% about dots in the past? Or how would you add randomness to the decision? Or 
% try to imagine a different mechanism for making the decision altogether, maybe 
% a "jump to conclusions" model that bases its choice on the first dot it sees 
% ... Only one of these things is enough to get the extra credit.
