%% NSCS 344, Week 7: 
%% Assignment 7: Handling data in Matlab
% **** Due date: Start of class in Week 8 ****
% 
% 
%% *Part 1: Look at the data (2 points)*
%% 
% * Download the behavioral data from D2L 
% * Load it into Matlab
% * Use "whos" to see what variables have been loaded
% * Print out the text of the questions to the Command Line
% * Follow along with the notes to image the choice data
%% Part 2: Plot the choice curves of people (2 points)
%% 
% * Follow along with the notes to plot the _average_ choice curve of all participants 
% in the data set
% * Make sure you have EV_safe - EV_risky on the x-axis and f_safe on the y-axis
% * Plot three choice curves for three _individual people_ from the data set.  
% Note the choice probabilities here will be either 0 or 1 because each person 
% only makes one choice for each. 
%% Part 3: Plot the softmax choice curve with the human choice curve
%% 
% * Follow along with the notes to plot the softmax choice curve on the same 
% plot as the human choice curve.
% * Start with a value of sigma = 3
% * Then make the same plot but with a smaller sigma (e.g. sigma = 1) and then 
% a larger sigma (e.g. sigma = 10)
% * Finally, see if you can tweak sigma to get as close as you can to the human 
% curve.  What's your best guess for sigma?  What does that mean?
%% Part 4: Process the blink rates (2 points)
%% 
% * Follow along with the text to compute the mean blink rate
% * Use the nanmedian function to compute the median blink rate
% * Use the nanstd function to compute the standard deviation of the blink rate
% * Use the max and min functions to compute the max and minimum blink rates 
% in the data set
% * Plot the histogram of blink rates using the hist function
%% Part 5: Individual differences in risk taking (2 points)
%% 
% * Follow along with the notes to compute the average risk taking for each 
% person
% * Use the hist function to compute the distribution over the average number 
% of times people choose the risky option
%% Part 6: The correlation between risk taking and blink rate (2 extra credit points)
%% 
% * Plot the relationship between risk taking and blink rate
% * Use the lsline function to add a best fitting straight line
% * Use the corr function to determine whether there is a statistically significant 
% relationship between blink rate and risk taking.
%% Part 7: Looking at the relationship between blinks and choice in a different way (2 more extra credit points!)			
% Another way to look at the effect of blink rate on choice is to compute the 
% choice curves (i.e. pRisk vs EV in Question 1) for high and low blink rate people. 
% To do this, perform a median split on blink rate and compute the choice curves 
% for high and low blink rate people. Does this plot give any additional insight 
% into the relationship between blink rate and risk taking?
