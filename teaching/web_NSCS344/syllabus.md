##	General course overview

###	Course description

The goal of this class is to provide an introduction to the art of computational modeling in Cognitive Science using the Matlab programming language.  Topics will include, how we model learning and simple decisions, how we connect computational models to observed experimental data (such as choices and neural activations) and how we can use modeling to design better experiments to test complex hypotheses.

The class will be very much a “hands on” class, every week students will create a different model, starting in class and finishing at home.  At the end, students should be able build a computational model from scratch, fit a model to data and determine which of a set of models best fits the observed experimental data.

### Format of the class

This class is an **online only** class - there will be no in person component.  Instead all material will be provided online on the D2L page for the class and there will be regular meeting times where you will meet with me or the TAs in groups to discuss the current week's work.

###	Course objectives and learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to:

  1)	Code in Matlab.
  2)	Build and simulate computational models of several different cognitive processes.
  3)	Compare computational models of cognition with experimental data to fit free parameters and to determine which model fits data the best.



###	Textbook

**There is no required textbook for this class!**

This is mainly because there isn't really a textbook for this topic and definitely not one at the undergraduate level.  To be honest, perhaps the best simple introduction to this topic was written by me in [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49547).

###	Prerequisites

None


---------------------------------------

## Coursework and grading

###	Grading scheme

Grades are entirely based on Assignments.  Students may drop the lowest _three_ assignments.

Grade boundaries will be at

  A	90-100%

  B	80-89%

  C	70-79%

  D	60-69%

  E	0-59%

Depending on aggregate class performance, these boundaries may be revised downwards (e.g. to 87% for an A if the class is harder than expected) but will never be revised upwards.

###	Assignments

  * Assignments will be based on the current week's material and will involve coding.
  * Assignments count for 80% of the grade in the class.
  * Your lowest three Assignment scores will be automatically dropped.
  * If you are unhappy with your grade on any assignment you can resubmit it.

### Final Project

  * The final project will account for 20% of your final grade
  * We will begin this in the last third of the semester
  * You will complete the project in groups
  * Half the credit for the final project will come from a "poster" presentation to the class (exactly how this will work in the online version of this class is TBD)
  * The other half will come from a written report (approx 1000 words).
  * _Note each person in your group must submit a separate written report_.  There will obviously be overlap between reports from the same group (e.g. similar figures) but the text should be your own.


###	Extra credit

Most Assignments will include extra credit items that ask you to go beyond what we covered in class. Completing these tasks is entirely optional.

###	Grade disputes

Grade disputes about quizzes, paper grades or exams will be entertained for one week from the day the grade is posted.

If you feel your work has been incorrectly graded please write a short memo explaining your concerns clearly and concisely and submit this memo to the TA.  We will then regrade the entire quiz, paper or exam, paying particular attention to the area of concern highlighted in the memo.  Please note, however, that mistakes happen in both directions and it is possible that your grade could go down as a result of a regrade.

----------------------------

##	Academic Integrity

Work on the assignments should all be your own --- although you are free to include feedback from the group discussions.  If we determine you have been cheating your will be reported to the Dean of Students.  We will penalize 1 letter grade on the entire class for the first instance of cheating. If we catch you cheating again you will fail the class.

More generally, you are expected to follow the University of Arizona Code of Academic Integrity:

* [UA code of academic integrity](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/code-academic-integrity)

----------------------------

##	General Policies

## Commitment to Diversity, Inclusion and Respect

### Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity unites and moves us forward.  The diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives that each student brings to this class will be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.  In this class, we have a unique and important opportunity to learn from the information and ideas shared by each other, and we also a responsibility to do so with sensitivity and respect.

Ideally, science would be objective.  However, as you will learn, much of science is subjective and is historically build on a small subset of privileged voices.  It is important to make note of this and to think about how significant research findings may be biased by their nature of being carried out on a typically small, non-representative sample of participants.

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that honors diverse identities (including race, ethnicity, gender, age, class, sexuality, nationality, religion, ability, etc.) and supports a diversity of experiences, thoughts, and perspectives. To learn more about the UA’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, please visit [https://diversity.arizona.edu](https://diversity.arizona.edu)


### Preferred Name and Gender Pronouns

This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities.  The university recognizes that many members of its community use names other than their legal or official names first provided to the university (official/legal name) to identify themselves.  For some, a chosen or preferred name may be an important component of their identity, especially their gender identity.

If you would prefer that a different name from your legal one or the one that appears on the class roster be used, the university has established guidelines that allow students and employees to indicate their chosen or preferred first names.  A student or employee’s preferred name will appear instead of the person’s official/legal name in select university-related systems and documents (e.g. D2L, official email display name, UAccess, etc.), provided that the preferred first name is not being used for the purpose of misrepresentation.  Please see the following link for more information: [http://lgbtq.arizona.edu/use-chosen-or-preferred-names](http://lgbtq.arizona.edu/use-chosen-or-preferred-names).

I want to be sure that the TAs and I refer to you in your preferred way.  If you prefer a name other than the one on our class roster, please let us know.  Since our communication is often via email, be sure to update your signature line and include your preferred pronouns. If we meet via Zoom, note that you can edit your name and include pronouns there, as well. We will try our best to remember your preferred names and pronouns, but please also feel free to give us a reminder.  Also, students are able to update and edit their pronouns in UAccess. To change your listed pronoun on UAccess, navigate to the Student Self Service page, go to the personal information section, and click on “Names”.  Options include (he, him, his), (she, her, hers), (they, them, theirs), (xe, xem, xyr), and (ze, zir).


### Land Acknowledgement
