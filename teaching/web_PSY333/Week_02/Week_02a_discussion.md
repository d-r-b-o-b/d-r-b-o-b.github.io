# Discussion Questions

_In your breakout groups please discuss these questions and write a brief sentence or two on each point.  Hand it in on D2L in the dropbox for Week_01_Discussion._

_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

  1. What is the Availability Heuristic?
  2. How does the Availability Heuristic explain why some people are afraid of flying?
  3. Go around your group and have everyone try to come up with an example of where the Availability Heuristic is at play. Pick one of these examples (it could be your own) and briefly describe how the Availability Heuristic biases judgments.
