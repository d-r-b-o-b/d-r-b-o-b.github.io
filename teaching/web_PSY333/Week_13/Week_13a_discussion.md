# Discussion Questions


_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

1. What's different between a regular Wisdom of the Crowd experiment and a Wisdom of the Interacting Crowd experiment?
2. Why do you think a crowd makes better judgments when it is allowed to interact?
3. When might interaction between people lead to worse decisions?
