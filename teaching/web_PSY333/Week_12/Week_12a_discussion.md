# Discussion Questions


_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

1. Give an example of a judgment or decision that people typically make in groups
2. The main thing we focussed on today was the "Wisdom of the Crowds."  Describe one of these Wisdom of the Crowds experiments - what happens and what do we mean when we say the crowd is wise?
