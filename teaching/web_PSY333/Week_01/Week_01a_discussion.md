# Discussion Questions

_In your breakout groups please discuss these questions and write a brief sentence or two on each point.  Hand it in on D2L in the dropbox for Week_01_Discussion._

_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

  1. Why are you here?  What do you think you will gain by learning more about judgment and decision making?
  2. More generally, why might studying judgment and decision making be a good thing, for example for society or for individuals within society?
  3. Bonus question - can you think of ways in which the study of judgment and decision making could be _bad_ for society?
