# Discussion Questions


_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

1. Why is it always best to defect in the Prisoner's dilemma if you only play it once?
2. Why is it probably better to try to cooperate if you are going to play the Prisoner's dilemma game with the same person multiple times?
3. How is the Game of Chicken similar to the situation between the US and the Soviet Union in the Cold War?
4. What do you think of Nixon's "Madman Theory" for trying to win the chicken game?
