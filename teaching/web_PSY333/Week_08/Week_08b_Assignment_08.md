## Expected Utility Theory

_Note: There are several ways you could do the drawings for this assignment.  If both Powerpoint and Word have drawing functions, although these can be a bit clumsy. Or if you're a coder you could make some code to draw the curves. Finally, if all else fails just draw it on paper, take a photo of it and paste it into your Word document._

1. Draw a concave utility curve.  Are people with this shape of utility curve risk averse or risk seeking? (3 points).




2. Draw a convex utility curve.  Are people with this shape of utility curve risk averse or risk seeking? (3 points)

_The remaining questions are based on this decision:_

  - _Option A: $100 for sure_
  - _Option B: $200 with 50% probability, $0 with 50% probability_

3. What is the expected value of option A? (1 point)

4. What is the expected value of option B? (1 points)

5. Pick you “favorite” utility curve (i.e. concave or convex). Show graphically that this utility curve is either risk seeking or risk averse. (2 points)
