# Discussion Questions

_In your breakout groups please discuss these questions and write a brief sentence or two on each point.  Hand it in on D2L in the dropbox for Week_01_Discussion._

_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

One classic illustration of the Representativeness Heuristic is the "Linda Problem."  In this experiment the authors asked participants to read a description of a woman called Linda

> _Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations._

They then had to judge whether Linda was more likely to be
<i>
  A. A bank teller
  B. A bank teller and and active in the feminist movement
</i>

  1. Why does the Representativeness Heuristic cause most people to say that B is more likely to true?
  2. Why is B the wrong answer?
  3. How might the Representativeness Heuristic lead people astray they are trying to hire someone for a job?
