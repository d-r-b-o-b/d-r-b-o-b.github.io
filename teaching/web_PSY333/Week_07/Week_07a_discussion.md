# Discussion Questions


_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

1. Give an example of a decision you have made in the real world.
2. What were the options you were deciding between?
3. Were you uncertain about the outcome of your decision?
4. How does your example differ from the simple gambling decisions we talked about in class?
