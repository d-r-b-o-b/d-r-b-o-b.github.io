# Discussion Questions


_Note we're not expecting perfect answers here, you should spend no more than 3-5 minutes on each question._

1. Sketch the subjective probability curve for Prospect theory
2. What are the two main features of this curve?
3. What heuristic that we did in the "Judgment" part of the class is at play to make us overestimate the likelihood of low probability events?
